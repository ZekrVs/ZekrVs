Hi, I'm ZekrVs, I'm a 21-year-old guy from Spain. I really like everything related to web development, I have enough experience (although somewhat basic) in the use of HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (and little bit of JavaScript). I'm currently learning Python and its different Frameworks. In the future, I hope to be able to work as a computer technician or as a web developer in a company.

Here I will upload my projects, most repositories will be private since I don't intend to share them with anyone.

ZekrVs/ZekrVs is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
